# ThinkPython2
Personal solutions to most of the exercises (hopefully) of the book: Think Python, 2nd edition by Allen B. Downey.
The solutions to some of the exercises are already provided by the author and in such cases my code is pretty much a copy of that (unsurprisingly the author's solutions are also the best solutions :D). 
You can download the PDF of the book at [Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/) or
