# ThinkPython2
Personal solutions to most of the exercises (hopefully) of the book: **Think Python, 2nd edition by Allen B. Downey** <br>
The solutions to some of the exercises are already provided by the author and in such cases I don't upload mine, or if I do, they will be pretty much a copy of the author's. <br>
You can download the PDF of the book at [Green Tea Press](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/ "Green Tea Press") or buy a printed copy at [O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/think-python-2nd/9781491939406/ "O'Reilly Media"). <br>
